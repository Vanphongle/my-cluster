# 🚀 My Homelab Kubernetes Cluster 🚀  

I want to **learn more about Kubernetes and self-hosting**, so I built this cluster!  
This is my hands-on journey toward **DevOps**, automation, and managing my own infrastructure.  

## 🌍 **Cluster Overview**  
- 🖥️ **Hardware:** 3x **Beelink SRE5** mini PCs  
- 🏗️ **OS:** **Talos OS** (Secure, minimal, and built for Kubernetes)  
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Experimenting with self-hosting, DevOps practices, and Kubernetes workloads  

## 🏗️ **What’s Running?**  
🔹 **[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/):** A lightweight, distributed storage solution (for now)  
🔹 **[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/):** Network-wide ad-blocking and DNS management 🛑  
🔹 **[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/):** Load balancing for external traffic  
🔹 **[Ingress Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/):** Ingress service  
🔹 **[Homepage Dashboard](https://gethomepage.dev/):** Homepage dashboard for my homelab services  

## 🔮 **Future Plans & Goals**  
I plan to expand my cluster with:  
🔹 **Ingress NGINX** for better traffic management 🚦  
🔹 **Home Assistant** for smart home automation 🏡  
🔹 **GitOps (FluxCD or ArgoCD)** for automated deployments ⚙️  
🔹 **Ceph storage (maybe later)** when I have more disks to test large-scale storage 🏗️  

This cluster is a learning playground for **self-hosting, infrastructure automation, and DevOps**.  
Excited to see where this journey takes me! 🚀
